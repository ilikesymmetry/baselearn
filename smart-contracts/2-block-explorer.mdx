In the previous section, we explored how to interact with a smart contract via CLI.
In this section, we'll explore how to interact with a smart contract via a block explorer.

**The block explorer is the single most important and underrated tool for anyone building onchain.**
Regardless of what part of the stack you work in (chain, smart contracts, backend, frontend), this is your ultimate debugging tool to understand what's actually happening onchain.

We'll use [Sepolia BaseScan](https://sepolia.basescan.org/) as our block explorer. 
Follow along with the following steps to get familiar navigating the block explorer.

## View Verified Source Code

First navigate to our deployed [Higher contract](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x4B2c6DFf1d611A0e31684FAEc557FFf7c675f525) from the previous section.
Then click on the `Contract` tab and you should see the verified source code.

## Read Contract

Click the `Read Contract` tab and you should see the contract's `height` function. Functions with arguments will have form fields for each argument.

## Write Contract

Click the `Write Contract` tab and you should see the contract's `higher` function. First, you need to connect your wallet by clicking `ðŸ”´ Connect to Web3`.
Then, you can call the `higher` function by clicking the function, entering the increase value, and clicking `Write` to submit the transaction request. 
Finally, approve the transaction in your wallet.

## View Logs

Click the `Events` tab and you should see the contract's `WentHigher` events. You can decode the event fields into specific types to be more human readable.

## Inspect Transactions

Click the `Transactions` tab and you should see the transactions submitted to the contract. Click on a transaction (example) to view its receipt.

### Logs

Click on the `Logs` subtab to view the logs for the transaction.

### Calldata

Expand the transaction details and scroll to the bottom to see the calldata. 

![Transaction Calldata](../images/transaction-calldata.gif)

This is the data that was sent from your wallet to the contract and encodes the function call and arguments. 
Note how the `Method ID` is the first 4 bytes of the calldata and the arguments are the remaining bytes.
This ID is also called the "function selector" and is used to identify the function to call by the smart contract.
The function selector is calculated by taking the first 4 bytes of the hash of the function signature (name and arguments).

Verify this yourself by running the following commands:
```bash
cast keccak "higher(uint256)"
cast calldata "higher(uint256)" 1
```

When a smart contract receives a call where the first 4 bytes do not match a known function selector, it will attempt to run a `fallback()` function and revert if it does not exist.

### Transaction Fee and Gas Values

The transaction fee is calculated using multiple gas-related parameters from the transaction.

The term "gas" is often used imprecisely to describe different things. To set the record straight:
* **Gas**: The amount of <Tooltip tip="Reads, writes, and other operations.">computational work</Tooltip> required to execute a transaction.
* **Gas Price**: The <Tooltip tip="EIP-1559 defines 'base fees' and 'priority fees' that dynamically adjust based on blockspace demand.">market price</Tooltip> of gas measured in units of ether per gas, most often <Tooltip tip="1 ether = 10^18 wei = 10^9 â€¢ 10^9 wei = 10^9 giga wei = 10^9 gwei">gwei</Tooltip>.
* **Gas Limit**: The maximum amount of gas to consume during execution.
* **Gas Used**: The amount of gas that was <Tooltip tip="Because of the delay between transaction submission and inclusion, executed code paths may differ due to conditionals.">actually used</Tooltip> to execute a transaction.
* **Transaction Fee**: The <Tooltip tip="Calculated by multiplying `gas used` and `gas price`.">amount of ether</Tooltip> that was paid for the transaction.

Keep the transaction details expanded to view all gas-related parameters.
